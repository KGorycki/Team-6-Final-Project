# Group-6-Final-Project
## Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier

CAP 4630: Intro to Artificial Intelligence
by Leah Brafford, Madison Bunsen, Kyle Gorycki, Elisheva El-Gad, and Yaser Qazait

- This project implements a binary image classifier that identifies whether an input image contains a cat or a dog.
- We trained a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a Kaggle dataset and evaluated it on a test set.
- Users can run the code to upload their own images and view the model’s predictions.
- For best results, run each cell of the code in Google Colab with GPU runtime unless you have an IDE with the needed packages already.

## Features

- Custom 4-block CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Strong data augmentation for improving generalization
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Interface for uploading and classifying your own images

## Dataset
We used this Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle:
